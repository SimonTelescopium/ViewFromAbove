# ViewFromAbove
Software to rectify Solar and Lunar Images to see features on the surface as they would appear if viewed from above, thus removing any foreshortening.

Until I can work out how to make installation packages the only way to use it is to install Gambas* for your Linux distribution then download and un-pack the source files then open the project, from there you can make an executable (project menu)

*Gambas https://gambaswiki.org/website/en/main.html is a Visual BASIC like, language and IDE for Linux, offering object oriented, event driven Basic - it is pretty fast too.
