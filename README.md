# ViewFromAbove
Software to rectify Solar and Lunar Images to see features on the surface as they would appear if viewed from above, thus removing any foreshortening of features on the limb of these objects.

## Installation
Until I can work out how to make installation packages the only way to use it is to install Gambas* for your Linux distribution then download and un-pack the source files then open the project in Gambas, from there you can make an executable (project menu)

*Gambas https://gambaswiki.org/website/en/main.html is a Visual BASIC like, language and IDE for Linux, offering object oriented, event driven Basic - it is pretty fast too.

Note: I'm a hobbiest coder, far from professional, so if you find my code objectional then don't use it, if you think it's poorly executed - you are probably right - if you have something constructive to say to help me learn, then please use language a beginner hobbiest will understand and be gentle I spent a lot of my free time learning to code this.
